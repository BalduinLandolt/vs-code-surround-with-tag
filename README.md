VS Code Extension "surround-with-tag"

## Features

This Extension provides simple functionality to surround any activated text/elements with a HTML/XML tag.

First, select some text in the editor. Then in the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), type "Surround with Tag" - or simply hit `Ctrl + I`. This will prompt a window, where you can type in the tag name. The opening and closing tags get inserted before and after the initial text selection.

## Requirements

None.

## Extension Settings

* `extension.surroundWithTag` (Command): Prompt surrounding with tag (Keybind: `Ctrl + I`)

## Known Issues

None so far.

Not all features are implemented, though. (See Roadmap below.)

The Extension has been tested under Windows 10. Any feedback on how it runs under Linux/MacOS is appreciated.

Please open an issue on github if you encounter any trouble or have feedback, suggestions or anything of that sort.

## Roadmap

Some of the following ideas might eventually be implemented:
* Extensive testing
* Multi Select support
* Options, where caret should end
* Emmet abbreviation support
