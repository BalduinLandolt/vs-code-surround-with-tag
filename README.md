## Features

This Extension provides simple functionality to surround any activated text/elements with a HTML/XML tag.

First, select some text in the editor. Then in the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), type "Surround with Tag" - or simply hit `Ctrl + I`. This will prompt a window, where you can type in the tag name. The opening and closing tags get inserted before and after the initial text selection.
